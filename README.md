# Xamarin_AgileDefender
Xamarin Forms Mobile Application

Premise of the application is to allow interaction with Agile Development teams, track progress of user stories, work items and bugs assigned to me, automate scrum details via integration with TFS and locate team members and track their work progress within sprints/iterations.
